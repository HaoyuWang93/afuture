								<h1>Another Future</h1>
								<p>...seems like the COVID pandemic is becoming another end-of-world event to be forgived,
									with some minor twists bringing us back to normal or the next threats coming into play;<br>
									What if, in an exceptional case, the pandemic (lethally) extended for decades?<br>
									What if social distancing became part of the next humanity?<br>
									<br>
									Another Future is an interactive architectural fiction propelled by a series of loosely linked stories in a(nother) post-2020 world.</p>
									<sub>Tip: you may find better experience on a mobile screen with motion sensor enabled, as most stories involve exploring 360Â° scenes (Web-VR) in first-person perspective and tapping buttons/ interactive objects to proceed;

						- Industry 5.0:<br>
						a comprehensive system of remote collaboration between digital workers and machinery that enables fully unmanned industrial

						the pre-pandemic visions of Level 5 autonomous vehicle that has been standardized for driverless

				These towns revitalize the pre-pandemic trends of digital nomads traveling

			<div class="content">
				<br>In contrast to nomads living in and traveling between COVID-free towns, the majority of the world's urban populations
				remain under the title 'commuter' for having unavoidable commuting and interpersonal contacts in physical workplaces.
				The inability to perform comprehensive social distancing makes commuter societies perfect incubators for COVID mutations
				and variant developments, which in turn destabilize their social production and commonwealth. On the other hand,
				5.0 technologies gradually drive out human-labored industries, often resulting in mass unemployment scenarios and
				violent conflicts in commuter societies.<br>
				<br>While most developing countries rely on market protection acts against foreign digital invasions for their commuter
				populations to remain competitive within domestic and allied markets, digitally developed countries establish various
				forms of labor reservations with targeted health measures, tax benefits, and subsidies to human-labored industries and
				commuter populations in an effort of reconciling social conflicts between the two sides of digital divisions.</p>
