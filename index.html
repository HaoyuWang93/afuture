								<h1>Another Future</h1>
								<p>What if the COVID pandemic continuously develops toward a distant future?<br>
									What if social distancing practice pushes technologies of remote work toward their maximized capacities?<br>
									<br>
									Another Future is my ongoing experiment towards an architectural fiction.<br>
									It takes an open-ended imagination of the Post-2020 world to a series of loosely linked stories.<br>
									I will keep posting new ideas, information, and stories to extend this work.<br>
									Please feel free to reach out for questions and ideas.<br>
									<br>
									Tip: you may find your mobile screen a better fit for panoramic scenes in the stories,<br>
									as no one would blame you for turning back and forth when you practice social distancing (¬‿¬)</p>

			<p>'...so why did you move out of campus?'<br>
				This recurring question comes from not only my digital worker fellows
				but also my social-distanced neighbors here in South Boston's submerged zone.
				As the Omega variant calls another victory of COVID against our latest vaccines,
				campus towers seem to be the only places free from the next inevitable lockdowns.
				When Campus Group initially advertised their unsinkable vertical city concept to the sea-rise victims,
				they probably didn't believe the towers' controlled access to be the biggest selling point in the face of Omega.<br>
				<br>
				It is true that as digital workers, our expectations for physical life lie on the leisure side.
				So we support controlled access to campus and any tracking measures inside,
				as long as we can have endless parties beside remote work while people outside struggle against COVID for their onsite jobs.
				On the other hand, I somehow smelt another level of lockdown framed by the tower's COVID-PASS infrastructure
				when watching service drones circled around for portal scanning sequence and hologram ads redirecting my walk to
				a 'healthier' lunch spot. My incremental fears for the next PASS updates culminated with my escape from campus
				and eventually led me to South Boston where I can live untrackable under masks and no longer be socially distanced
				from the entire city.<br>
				<br>
				However, this life is about to change when DPH announces the city's next response to the upcoming Omega...</p>
