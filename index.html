			<p>'...so why did you move out of campus?'<br>
				<br>
				This recurring question comes from not only my digital fellows
				but also my social-distanced neighbors here in the submerged South Boston.
				As the Omega variant calls another victory of COVID against vaccines,
				campus towers seem to be the only places free from the next inevitable lockdowns.
				Campus Group probably won't believe that their vertical city concept would win this year for controlled access
				rather than being 'unsinkable' as they initially advertised to sea-rise victims.<br>
				<br>
				It is true that as digital workers, our expectations for physical beings lie on the leisure side.
				So we support controlled access to campus and any tracking measures inside,
				as long as we can have endless parties while people outside struggle against COVID for their onsite jobs.
				On the other hand, I somehow smelt another level of lockdown framed by the tower's COVID-PASS infrastructure
				when watching service drones circled around for portal scanning sequence and hologram ads redirecting my walk to
				a 'healthier' lunch spot. My incremental fears for the next PASS updates culminated with my escape from campus
				and eventually led me to South Boston, where I can live untrackable under masks and no longer be socially distanced
				from the entire city.<br>
				<br>
				However, this life is about to change when DPH announces the city's next response to the upcoming Omega...</p>
