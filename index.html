				<p>The continuous fights between mutative COVID developments and corresponding public health actions gradually shape new
					urban norms of regulated social distancing practice, periodical vaccination reinforcements, and graded lockdowns
					for different scenarios (L0 for masked access to public space - L5 for absolute quarantine);<br>
					<br>
					Digital space evolves into a collection of workplaces, schools, shopping sites, social clubs, amusement parks,
					courts, and voting boxes, that accommodates the majority of one's work and life, whereas cities and local
					communities reduce to public health units powered by their Department of Public Health (DPH) to regulate COVID measures;<br>
					<br>
					Public investments in digital production, service, and infrastructure grow under the drastic work-life transitions;
					information and material exchanges online become fundamental skills for individuals;
					 internet access becomes a formally acknowledged human right;<br>
					<br>
					Digital gaps between industries and corresponding workforces evolve into spatial segregations between the
					'safer' communities of digital workers with controlled access and the commuter's neighborhoods that are regarded
					as COVID-saturated and can often become 'unemployed neighborhoods' during lockdowns;<br>
					<br>
					The increasing online employment, education, and commercial activities raise political tensions on cross-border laborforce,
					 taxation, and market regulation, initiating the great war between the local protection acts of geopolitics and foreign digital invasions;<br>
						 <br>
					USA, Russia, and EU troops retreat from battlefields for reduced expenses under economic hardship; however,
					their military interventions remain active in the Middle East, North Africa, and Central Aisa in forms of proxy wars on relevant interests;</p>

						providing uninterrupted digital access for people at home and machines across borders;<br>
						<br>
						- Industry 5.0:<br>
						a comprehensive system of remote collaboration between digital workers and machinery that has been developed in
						Germany and Japan and widely adopted in global economy, enabling fully unmanned production under remote controls and automated procedures
						to recover industrial productivity under persistent COVID impacts;<br>
						<br>
						- Mobility 5.0:<br>
						the pre-pandemic visions of Level 5 autonomous vehicle that has been standardized for driverless
						forms of air, ground, and aquatic transportations, thanks to the restricted personal mobility that helps the
						legislation for driverless zones in cities as well as heavy public investments in relevant services such
						as Amazon and Uber Air;<br>
						<br>
						On the other hand, oppositions rise among the digitally disadvantaged societies and stakeholders of onsite
						laborforces with major concerns regarding employment opportunities, techno-monopolies, and cultural identities of production;</p>

				<p>5.0 Technologies thrives across diverse industries and services under the significant strike of Sigma variant on
					human-labored industries. While commuters have to maintain a mobile COVID-PASS by performing infection
					scans at most door-to-door scenarios for their everyday onsite work, digital workers enjoy uninterrupted employment at home;
					the spatial separation between two populations continues to evolve, where commuters accumulate at hiring sites
					while digital workers relocate to resort-like suburban communities or urban towers that vertically separated from 'risky'
					zones;<br>
					<br>
					Digital economies rapidly occupy the less-inhabitable lands of Saraha, Siberia, West Australia, Tibet, and remote islands on open waters
					to built unmanned production facilities for food and industrial products; on the other hand, the limited energy resource
					and depressed consumer markets support few active slots for digital workforces. The majority of populations, especially
					in the digitally disadvantaged societies of Global South, rely on market protection acts to remain productive
					under continuous COVID impacts. Developed countries also establish industrial reservations to reconcile the
					social conflicts brought by digital divisions. On the other hand, the inability to perform social distancing makes
					labor-intense industries perfect COVID incubators for mutations and variant developments, which in turn destabilize
					the employment and commonwealth of onsite working populations;</p>

			<p>'...so why did you move out of campus?'<br>
				<br>
				This recurring question comes from not only my digital fellows
				but also my social-distanced neighbors here in the submerged zone of South Boston.
				As the Omega variant calls another victory of COVID against vaccines,
				campus towers seem to be the only places free from the next inevitable lockdowns.
				Campus Group probably won't believe that their vertical city concept would sell this year for controlled access
				rather than being 'unsinkable' as they initially advertised to sea-rise victims.<br>
				<br>
				It's true that as digital workers, our expectations for physical beings lie on the leisure side.
				So we support controlled access to campus and any tracking measures inside,
				as long as we can have endless parties while people outside struggle against COVID for their onsite jobs.
				On the other hand, I somehow smelt another level of lockdown framed by the COVID-PASS infrastructure
				when watching service drones circled around for portal scanning sequence and hologram ads redirecting my walk to
				a 'healthier' lunch spot downstairs. My incremental fears for the next PASS updates culminated with my escape from campus
				and eventually led me to South Boston, where I can live untrackable under masks and no longer be socially distanced
				from the real city.<br>
				<br>
				However, this life is about to change when DPH announces the city's next response to the upcoming Omega...</p>
