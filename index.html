				<p>5.0 Technologies thrives across diverse industries and services under the significant strike of Sigma variant that imposes
					L5 lockdowns across the world. Digital economies rapidly occupy the less-inhabitable lands and waters to built unmanned
					production facilities; digital workers adopt the title of 'nomad' for spending most of their time and energy somewhere
					across screens while living in resort-like communities with limited physical exposures to the COVID-saturated world outside; <br>
					<br>
					On the other hand, the digital divisions intensify as digital economies continuously drive out human-labored industries
					while providing limited employment slots to rebalance social structures. Apart from the intensified competition in
					digital entrepreneurship and online job markets across borders, a majority of urban populations remain under the title of 'commuter'
					for having physical workplace with unavoidable commuting and interpersonal contacts. While most countries of the global south sign
					market protection acts against foreign digital invasions, digitally developed countries also establish industrial reservations
					to reconcile social conflicts between the two distinctive populations. On the other hand, the inability to perform social distancing makes
					labor-intense industries perfect incubators for COVID mutations and variant developments, which in turn destabilize the employment
					and commonwealth of commuter societies;</p>

				<p>The 5.0-equipped digital economies raise political tensions on cross-border laborforce, taxation, and market regulation,

					among nomads which further dilute the notion of citizen and residency in social production;<br>
					<br>
					The 2035 UN World Summit initiates United Digital Nations (UDN) as an intergovernmental division to reinforce geopolitical power
					structures through collaborative regulations on cross-border productions, digital markets, jurisdictions, and taxations;

			<p>'...so why did you move out of campus?'<br>
				<br>
				This recurring question comes from not only my nomad fellows but also my commuting neighbors here in South Boston.
				As the Omega variant calls another victory of COVID against vaccines, campus towers seem to be the only places free from lockdowns
				for having PASS systems to secure our party nights. On the other hand, my campus experience saw a greater social distancing when working
				on my Sahara solar farm across screen, buying 'Bostonian' pleasures filtered by PASS, and watching commuters' demonstrations below for their
				onsite jobs. South Boston may no longer have any pleasure left, but I can feel closer to the city of my imagination by walking
				anonymously on the street and blending my daily routines into the neighborhood.<br>
				<br>
				However, this city may be more fragile than I used to believe...</p>
