									<h1>About</h1>
									<br>
									<p>Another Future is an open-ended architectural fiction that converges the shared cultural pursuit between architectural discourse and SF (science fiction) on urban and social imagination.
										It emerges from my interests in the drastic social quakes brought by COVID-19 and the simultaneous revelation of environmental changes after decades of underlaying developments.
										Although architects and SF communities have both been producing alternative futures on these topics by imposing hypothetical stimuli (design concepts and SF novums) on existing human conditions,
										the affirmativeness of design and the cultural provocation of SF world-building deliver nearly opposite qualities of imagination, for which the ideas of 'SF comes into reality' and
										'architecture has to change' inevitably merge at the post-2020 images.<br>
										<br>
									The project aims to incorporate architectural imagination and SF into a web-based narrative of a post-2020 world that reflects on the fears and wonders of contemporary human conditions across scales.
									Instead of heroizing architecture or fictional characters in the narrative, this project focuses on possible scenarios of interactions, counter-actions, conflicts, and compromises between humans
									and their space. As a storytelling experiment that aims for general audiences, the project visualizes architectural and urban scenarios through first-person panoramic scenes and animations
									intersected by monologues, dialogues, and digital interface for an immersive experience on mobile and desktop screens. The media forms and visual styles vary between individual stories as I experiment
									with new techniques. I would also like to reposition architectural design as narrative devices to raise questions that lead to 'ANOTHER futures' instead of reconciling conflicts
									for 'THE future' as architects would professionally do. The idea to call 'another' is also for wishing a more hopeful version to happen in reality. <br>
