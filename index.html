					<br>
					Digital gaps reveal between the industries advanced of remote operation and the majority others requiring onsite work,
					which also widens economic gaps between the corresponding laborforce;<br>
					<br>
					Public health measures become a contesting ground for economic, political, cultural, and spatial conflicts
					from individual to international scales;<br>
					<br>
					The paused social production also intensifies the historically established racial and political tensions;<br>

					for different scenarios (L1 for masked access to public space - L5 for absolute quarantine);<br>
					<br>
					Internet evolves into a placeless collection of workplaces, schools, shopping sites, social clubs, amusement parks,
					courts, and voting boxes that collectively reformulate one's work-live habits, whereas cities and local communities virtually
					reduce to public health units for COVID-related regulations and actions;<br>
					<br>
					Public investments in digital production and service grow under the drastic work-life transitions;
					online exchange of information and material become fundamental skills for human life;
					internet access becomes a formally acknowledged human right;<br>
					<br>
					Digital gaps between industries and corresponding workforces evolve into spatial segregations between the
					'safer' communities of digital workers with controlled access and the 'risky' commuter's neighborhoods with unstable
					social distancing practice, which can often turn into 'unemployed neighborhoods' during lockdowns;<br>

						providing uninterrupted digital access for people at home and machines across borders; ;<br>
						<br>
						- Industry 5.0:<br>
						a comprehensive system of remote collaboration between digital workers and machinery that enables fully unmanned industrial
						activities through automated procedures and remote human interventions; relevant technologies are initially developed to sustain
						the productivity of primary industries during COVID lockdowns and then been widely adopted in other industrial businesses of
						various scales;<br>
						<br>
						- Mobility 5.0:<br>
						the pre-pandemic visions of Level 5 autonomous vehicle that has been standardized for driverless
						forms of air, ground, and aquatic transportations, thanks to the restricted personal mobility that helps their training and
						legislation in most cities as well as heavy public investments in relevant services such as Amazon and Uber Air;<br>
						<br>
						On the other hand, oppositions rise among the digitally disadvantaged societies and stakeholders of human-labored industries
						with major concerns regarding employment opportunities, techno-monopolies, and cultural identities of production;</p>
