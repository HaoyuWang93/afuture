									<h1>About</h1>
									<br>
									<p>Another Future is an open-ended architectural fiction that evolves upon the shared cultural pursuit
										between architectural discourse and SF (science fiction) on social imagination.
										It originates from my interests in the drastic social quakes brought by COVID-19 and
										the simultaneous revelation of environmental changes after decades of underlaying developments.
										Although architects and SF communities have both been producing alternative futures on relevant agendas
										by introducing hypothetical stimuli to existing paradigms, the affirmativeness of design and the
										cultural provocation of SF world-building deliver nearly opposite qualities of imagination,
										for which the ideas of 'SF becomes reality' and 'architecture has to change' inevitably merge at the extended images of 2020.<br>
										<br>
										The project aims to incorporate architectural imagination and SF into a web-based narrative of a post-2020 world that reflects back
										 on the fears and wonders of contemporary human conditions altered by COVID-19 and the corresponding shifts to remote work for social production.
										 Instead of heroizing architecture or fictional characters in the narrative, this project focuses on possible scenarios of interactions, counter-actions,
										  conflicts, and compromises between humans and the built environment. As a storytelling experiment that aims for general audiences,
											the project visualizes architecture and urban scenarios through first-person views of panoramic scenes and videos intersected by
											monologues, dialogues, and digital interface displays for an immersive and responsive experience on mobile and desktop screens. I would also like to reposition
											architectural design as narrative devices to raise questions that lead to 'another' futures instead of reconciling conflicts for
											'the future' as architects would professionally do. The idea to call 'another' is also for wishing a more hopeful version to happen in reality. <br>
